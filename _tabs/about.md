### I'm Sam.

I began my degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Bath in 2014. 

In 2017 I started to work on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), both as an integral part of my degree course and as an extra-curricular activity at university. From this I gained a strong interest in robotic systems and their uses.

In my final undergraduate year I took on the role of Project Manager at Team Bath Drones, leading a team of seven undergraduates to success in winning the Design Award at an inter-university competition.

After graduation in 2019, I began working in the UAS industry.
