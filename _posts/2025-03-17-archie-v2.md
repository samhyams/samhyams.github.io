After the success of my [first oblique wing prototype last spring](https://samhyams.com/posts/flying-the-oblique-wing/), I put a few hours on the airframe before unfortunately destroying it. Turns out the stall response with the wing swept was not very benign! Anyway, I ended up regretting losing the airframe so after the winter break I started on developing a second version. The redesign was not a huge task, using the same wing with a few tweaks and the same tail with a fixed tailplane angle. However, I completely redesigned the fuselage from scratch to give more space for electronics, a wider CG margin, and make working on the internals easier. I also made a lot of improvements to make the printing experience better, as I wanted to release the files for public download to anyone brave enough to try their own model. My nickname for the original version was _Archie_, and as the new version 2 is all grown up I have called it _Archer_.

_Archer awaits the maiden flight_

The initial version 2 flight was on February 1st and was thankfully uneventful after the issues that version 1 had during the initial flights. The ArduPlane PID gains transferred across from the original which made it easy to maiden with an auto-takeoff. Before releasing to the public, I wanted to ensure I had the files exported nicely and a full assembly guide made. I underestimated the amount of effort this would take and, thanks also to a period of illness, it took me until mid-March to finish the guide and upload. You can find the [guide here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xMhwQXuymO50eh_G8XK65f9L1NIVUlB3/view?usp=drive_link) and if you are interested in building your own swing wing demonstrator you can find the files available [on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1232467-archer-oblique-wing-rc-plane).

Now for a few more shots of version 2!
